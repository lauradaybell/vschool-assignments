            <h2>Promotes Harmony</h2>
            <p class="health">Reiki helps to promote harmony and balance. It is an effective, non invasive energy healing modality that enhances the body’s natural healing ability whilst energising and promoting overall wellness. Reiki works directly on restoring balance on all levels and works directly on the problem and condition instead of just masking or relieving symptoms. When we chat about balance, we mean mental and emotional balance, left and right brain, masculine and feminine, labelling things as good or bad, positive or negative etc.<p>
            <h2>Time To Just "Be"</h2>
            <p class="health">What many people enjoy about a reiki treatment is it allows them time to themselves where they aren’t ‘doing’ but just ‘being’. Clients have reported feeling more clear, peaceful, relaxed and lighter in themselves.</p>
            <h2>A Safe Place</h2>
            <p class="health">Reiki provides a space where you can be more aware of what is going on inside your body and mind. To learn to listen to your own body and make wise decisions regarding your well being from this place. Being more present means you are in your body, which helps you to access even more that inner knowing and wisdom that we all have!</p>
