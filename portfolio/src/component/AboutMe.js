            <p>
                I am a problem solver.  Most of my work experience has been in positions that required strong problem solving abilities.  Through years as a medical billing specialist, I honed my ability to find ways to make square pegs fit in round holes (not always pretty, but effective!).  As a mom I learned that the same problem can require many different solutions.  
                As a full stack JavaScript student I've learned that there is no limit to what we can create.  I've also learned that I can break just about anything that can be created...  Sometimes I can even fix it after I break it!  I'm excited to continue learning, problem solving, and building new things.
